# Omasend

Send and receive files and messages between your Omarchy desktop and anything
running [LocalSend](https://localsend.org) — phones, laptops, other Linux
boxes — without opening an app. Omasend is a **native plugin for the Omarchy 4
desktop shell** (`omarchy-shell`): a paper-plane icon in the bar, a panel for
devices, messages and transfers, and an always-on receiver that runs quietly
with the shell.

It speaks the LocalSend v2.1 protocol, including the default encrypted (HTTPS)
mode, so stock LocalSend apps see it as just another device.

## Quick start

On an Omarchy 4 desktop, add the plugin the standard way:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/28allday/omasend-quattro.git --enable
```

Click the paper-plane icon in the bar to open the panel. Transfers are handled
by a small companion binary — the engine — which a plugin install can't place
on its own, so the first time you open the panel head to **Settings › Engine**
and press **Set up engine**.

That compiles the engine from the source sitting in the plugin's own checkout,
which needs Go (`sudo pacman -S go`). It's a deliberate choice: the thing that
listens on your network is built from code you can read in the same directory,
rather than a binary you have to take on trust.

Prefer the terminal? The same script the button runs:

```sh
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nosignal.omasend/bin/omasend-setup
```

There's also `install.sh` in the repo, which does the above plus the optional
extras — the bar icon, the Nautilus right-click entry and zenity. Run it from a
clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/28allday/omasend-quattro.git
cd omasend-quattro && bash install.sh
```

Then, on the devices you want to talk to:

- **Phone or tablet** — install the free [LocalSend app](https://localsend.org)
  (iOS / Android). On the same Wi-Fi, it and your desktop find each other
  automatically.
- **Another desktop or laptop** — the official LocalSend app, or Omasend on
  another Omarchy 4 box.
- **A headless server** — the
  [omarchy-send](https://github.com/28allday/omarchy-send) terminal client.

Send something from the other device and it appears as an offer in the panel;
accept it and it lands in `~/Omasend`. That's it.

## Highlights

- **Always receiving** — if the desktop is running, the box can receive. Files
  land in `~/Omasend`, and a desktop notification tells you when they arrive.
- **Bar icon** — a paper plane in the bar; it badges on unread messages and
  active transfers, and a click opens the panel.
- **Send anything** — pick a device and press `f` for files or `Shift+F` for a
  whole folder (sent recursively, structure preserved), or right-click files
  in Nautilus → **Send via Omasend** to open the panel with your selection
  already staged.
- **Messages** — LocalSend-compatible plain-text messages in both directions:
  compose from a device row, read in the Messages tab.
- **You stay in control** — incoming offers show an accept/decline strip
  (auto-accept is optional), and an optional PIN gates who can send to you.
- **Finds devices anywhere** — multicast discovery on the LAN, automatic
  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) peers, and manual add-by-host/IP for
  everything else.
- **Scriptable** — send files or messages from scripts and AI agents through
  the shell's IPC, no UI involved.

## Requirements

Omarchy 4 with `omarchy-shell` — the UI is a shell plugin. On a headless or
pre-quattro box the panel can't run; use the original
[omarchy-send](https://github.com/28allday/omarchy-send) terminal client
there instead. Both speak the same protocol and happily talk to each other.

External dependencies: `jq` (already in the Omarchy base install), Go to build
the engine (`sudo pacman -S go`), and
[zenity](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity) for the panel's graphical
file chooser — the installer offers to add zenity if it's missing. Nothing at
runtime: the engine is a single static binary with no dependencies once built.

## Install details

**Why there are two pieces.** The UI is pure QML and loads straight into the
shell. The LocalSend protocol work — discovery, HTTPS transfers, PIN — lives in
`omasend-engine`, a small Go daemon, because the shell can't load native code.
`omarchy plugin add` installs the QML; the engine is a separate binary, so
`bin/omasend-setup` places it.

**Where the engine comes from.** `bin/omasend-setup` ships inside the plugin
and builds `./cmd/omasend-engine` from the source beside it. Nothing is
downloaded, so the running binary is precisely the commit you installed, and
you can audit it without leaving the directory.

That needs Go. Without it the script stops and says so rather than quietly
fetching something prebuilt. If you'd rather not install a toolchain, you can
opt in explicitly:

```sh
OMASEND_ALLOW_PREBUILT=1 bin/omasend-setup
```

That downloads the release pinned in `manifest.json` — never `latest` — and
installs it only if the SHA-256 matches `engine/SHA256SUMS`, committed in this
repo; a mismatch aborts and installs nothing. It's off by default because a
prebuilt binary can't be checked against the source in front of you, however
well pinned it is.

Overrides: `BIN_DIR=…` puts the engine somewhere else, `OMASEND_REPO=user/repo`
uses a fork's releases. `bin/omasend-setup --check` reports what's installed
without changing anything.

**What `install.sh` adds.** Everything above plus the optional desktop extras:
the bar icon, the Nautilus right-click entry (copied from the checkout), and
[zenity](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity) if it's missing (asks for
sudo) — the graphical chooser behind the panel's "Send file/folder" buttons;
without it they fall back to a typed-path prompt. It's safe to re-run, and
`omarchy plugin update` keeps the plugin itself current.

**Coming from omarchy-send?** Your identity survives: the first run migrates
`~/.config/omarchy-send/config.json` — alias, PIN, receive folder and the TLS
certificate — so devices that already paired with you stay paired. The old TUI
and Omasend can't run at the same time on one machine (both need port 53317).

## Using it

Click the paper plane in the bar, or from a terminal:

```sh
omarchy-shell shell toggle nosignal.omasend
```

The panel is fully keyboard-driven:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move through the list |
| `Enter` / `m` | Message the selected device (sends staged items instead, if any are staged) |
| `f` / `Shift+F` | Pick files / a folder to send to the selected device |
| `+` | Add a remote device by host or IP |
| `a` / `d` | Accept / decline an incoming offer |
| `x` | Clear staged items |
| `1`–`4` / `Tab` | Switch tabs |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close the panel |

Every row also works with the mouse — the icons on a device row send a
message, files, or a folder directly. A single click only selects a device;
**double-click** it to send whatever you have staged (or to open a message
when nothing is staged).

### Receiving

Anything sent to you lands in `~/Omasend`. Files still on their way carry a
`.part` suffix until they're complete. With auto-accept off (the default),
each incoming batch shows an offer strip at the top of the panel — accept or
decline it; unattended offers simply expire. Flip **Auto-accept** in Settings
if you'd rather everything just arrives.

Set a **PIN** in Settings and senders must enter it before anything reaches
you — the same PIN mechanism the official LocalSend apps use.

**Files arriving but no notification?** Check Do Not Disturb — with DND on,
the shell still accepts every notification and files it into history, it just
never shows one, so arrivals land silently in `~/Omasend`. Run
`omarchy-shell notifications dndState` to check, `setDnd off` to turn it off,
and `showHistory` to replay what you missed.

### Messages

Incoming messages raise a notification and badge the bar icon; the Messages
tab keeps the recent conversation (messages live in the panel, not on disk).
Press `Enter` on a device to reply.

### Transfers

The Transfers tab shows live progress for everything moving in either
direction. Dismiss finished rows individually, or press `c` to clear all
finished transfers.

### Right-click in Nautilus

Select files or folders in Nautilus, right-click → **Send via Omasend**. The
panel opens with your selection staged — pick a device, press `Enter`, done.

### Remote devices

Multicast discovery only reaches your own LAN. For everything else: online
Tailscale peers are discovered automatically when Tailscale is running, and
`+` adds any device by host or IP, remembered for next time.

### From scripts and agents

The shell exposes Omasend over IPC, so anything on the box can send without a
UI or a TTY:

```sh
omarchy-shell omasend send "phone" "on my way"          # message
omarchy-shell omasend sendFile "phone" "/path/to/file"  # file or folder
omarchy-shell omasend status                            # engine health
```

Sends are queued and delivered asynchronously; a failure raises a desktop
notification. The installer also writes a managed block into
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so AI agents on the machine know how to use it.

## Troubleshooting

**No paper-plane icon in the bar.** The icon is a bar-layout entry in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, separate from the entry that makes the panel
loadable — so the panel can open perfectly while no icon shows. Ask the shell,
not the bar:

```sh
omarchy plugin list | grep nosignal.omasend
```

For a bar widget, `disabled` there means "has no place in the bar", whatever
the panel is doing. Enabling again won't fix it: `omarchy plugin enable` places
the widget only when the plugin is referenced nowhere in `shell.json`, and
opening the panel leaves a reference of its own. Clear it first:

```sh
omarchy plugin disable nosignal.omasend
omarchy plugin enable nosignal.omasend right
```

Re-running `bin/omasend-setup` does exactly that for you, and leaves an icon
you have already positioned where it is.

**"Send file/folder" does nothing.** The GTK chooser needs `zenity`, which
isn't in the Omarchy base install: `sudo pacman -S zenity`. No shell restart
needed — the panel re-checks on the next attempt.

## Under the hood

Two parts: a pure-QML shell plugin (bar widget, panel, service) and
`omasend-engine`, a small Go daemon that speaks the LocalSend protocol —
discovery, HTTPS transfers, PIN, the lot. The shell starts and supervises the
engine and talks to it over a local socket; nothing listens beyond LocalSend's
standard port `53317` (TCP + UDP). Configuration lives in
`~/.config/omasend/config.json`. If you run a firewall, allow `53317` for both
TCP and UDP on your LAN.

## What it installs and writes

Everything lands under your home directory — nothing is written system-wide.
`omarchy plugin add` writes only the first two rows; the rest arrive when you
set up the engine, run `install.sh`, or start receiving:

| Path | What goes there |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nosignal.omasend/` | the plugin itself, cloned by `omarchy plugin add` |
| `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` | a `plugins[]` entry and a bar-layout entry, so the icon and panel load |
| `~/.local/bin/omasend-engine` | the transfer engine, placed by `bin/omasend-setup` |
| `~/.config/omasend/config.json` | your alias, PIN, receive folder, known remotes and TLS certificate |
| `~/Omasend/` | received files (configurable in Settings) |
| `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/` | the paper-plane icon |
| `~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/omasend.py` | the "Send via Omasend" right-click entry |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | a delimited managed block telling AI agents how to send from scripts |

Two of those are edits to files you may already own, so to be explicit about
them: the `shell.json` entries are added with `jq` and leave the rest of the
file untouched (the plugin re-adds its own `plugins[]` reference on first open
if the shell dropped it — without that, removing the bar icon would kill the
panel too); and the `CLAUDE.md` block sits between
`<!-- BEGIN omasend -->` / `<!-- END omasend -->` markers, so re-running the
installer replaces only that block and never the surrounding file. Neither is
overwritten wholesale.

The one privileged step is installing zenity — `sudo pacman -S zenity`, only
if it isn't already present, and it's non-fatal if you decline. The engine
listens on LocalSend's standard port `53317` (TCP + UDP) whenever the shell is
running; that's the whole point of always-on receiving, and it's the only
network listener.

## Uninstall

```sh
omarchy plugin remove nosignal.omasend
rm ~/.local/bin/omasend-engine
rm ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/omasend.py
rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/omasend.svg
rm -rf ~/.config/omasend            # alias, PIN, pairing certificate
```

That leaves received files in `~/Omasend` alone. The managed block in
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is delimited by its `BEGIN`/`END` markers if you want to
delete it by hand.
